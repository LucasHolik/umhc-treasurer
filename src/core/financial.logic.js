/**
 * Calculates financial totals and balances, accounting for "Manual" transactions as historical adjustments.
 *
 * Logic:
 * - "Manual" transactions represent activity that occurred prior to the configured Opening Balance.
 * - They are INCLUDED in `totalIncome` and `totalExpenses` so they appear in reports and charts.
 * - To prevent these historical amounts from double-counting against the start balance, the
 *   Opening Balance is adjusted inversely:
 *     - Manual Expense: Increases Adjusted Opening Balance.
 *     - Manual Income: Decreases Adjusted Opening Balance.
 *
 * This ensures:
 *   Current Balance = Adjusted Opening Balance + Total Income - Total Expenses
 *   (Where the net effect of manual transactions on the Current Balance is zero).
 *
 * @param {number|string} openingBalance - The configured initial balance.
 * @param {Array} transactions - List of all transactions.
 * @returns {object} - { manualOffset, adjustedOpeningBalance, currentBalance, totalIncome, totalExpenses }
