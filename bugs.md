# Bugs

Known bugs, open and fixed. Bugs outside the current part's scope are recorded
here rather than fixed on the spot; `high` and `critical` bugs go to the user
straight away. A fixed bug names the regression test that covers it.

## Open

### B-002: A comma-formatted opening balance is read as 1

**Description.** `Service_Sheet.getOpeningBalance()` parses Config!C2 with
`parseFloat`, which stops at a comma. If the cell holds `"1,200"` as text, the
server returns 1. `calculateFinancials` then receives that number, so its own
`parseFloat` cannot recover the lost digits. Every balance is wrong by 1199.

**Steps to reproduce.** Format Config cell C2 as plain text, enter `1,200` and
reload. Settings shows the Base Opening Balance as 1, and the dashboard Current
Balance is 1 while there are no transactions.

**Severity.** Low. The settings form rejects a comma (it uses `Number()`), and
a General-format cell coerces `1,200` to a number, so this needs a manually
formatted text cell.

**Where.** The primary fault is `google-apps-script/Service_Sheet.gs:316`.
`src/core/financial.logic.js:29` is a secondary defensive parse and cannot fix
the value on its own.

**Status.** Open. Found during the Phase 1 review and recorded, not fixed. A
fix belongs in the backend parser, with a regression test that fails without
it.

## Fixed

### B-001: `pnpm format:check` fails on `main`

**Description.** The formatting gate failed before any change was made. Prettier
reported four files under `.archify/architecture-umhc-treasurer-20261005-162240/`
as badly formatted. The files are generated output from the `archify` skill.

**Steps to reproduce.** On `main`, run `pnpm format:check`. It exits non-zero
with warnings for `candidate.json`, `umhc-treasurer.finalize.json`,
`umhc-treasurer.finalize-summary.json` and `umhc-treasurer.html`.

**Severity.** Low. Nothing in the app is affected; the documented check could
not pass.

**Where.** `.archify/architecture-umhc-treasurer-20261005-162240/`.

**Status.** Fixed in Phase 1, part 3 by adding `.archify/` to `.prettierignore`
(see D-005). There is no unit test for this: `pnpm format:check` is the check
itself, and it now passes on the whole repository.
