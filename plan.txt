# UMHC Finance Hub - Refactored Implementation

## Overview
A web application that allows users to upload financial data from Excel files (.xlsx) to a Google Sheet, with robust duplicate detection and timezone-safe date handling. The application has been refactored to be modular and expandable.

## Core Features

### Client-Side (JavaScript)
- **Modular Architecture:** The JavaScript code is divided into modules for UI, API, Excel parsing, and data handling.
- **Authentication:** Secure login system using API key stored in Google Sheet.
- **Excel Processing:** Client-side Excel file parsing using `read-excel-file` library.
- **Google Sheets Integration:** Uploads data to 'Finances' Google Sheet.
- **Duplicate Detection:** Client-side duplicate checking to avoid uploading existing records.
- **Data Processing:** Chunked upload system for large datasets.
- **Date Handling:** String-only date processing to prevent timezone conversion issues.
- **User Interface:** Simple login, file upload, and data preview functionality.

### Server-Side (Google Apps Script)
- **Modular Architecture:** The Google Apps Script code is organized into separate files for the main entry point, configuration, sheet interaction, and authentication.
- **Automatic Sorting:** The Google Sheet is automatically sorted by date (most recent first) after every data upload, while carefully handling date and timezone conversions.
- **API Endpoints:** Provides endpoints for login, saving data, and retrieving data.
- **Batch Operations:** Uses batch operations for efficient Google Sheets updates.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Includes error handling for all major operations.
- **JSONP Communication:** Uses JSONP for communication with the client-side application.
