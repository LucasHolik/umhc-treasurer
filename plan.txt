# Project Plan: UMHC Finance Hub

## Guiding Principles

This project will be developed with a professional, modular, and expandable architecture in mind. Our goal is to create a robust and maintainable tool for the long term.

We will follow an iterative development process:
- **Small, Incremental Changes:** We will implement features in small, manageable steps.
- **Continuous Verification:** After each step, we will test and verify that the changes work as expected before moving on.

## High-Level Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation
The initial focus is on creating a secure and reliable backend to store and manage financial data.
- **Database:** A Google Sheet will serve as the central database for all transactions.
- **API Layer:** A Google Apps Script will be developed to act as a secure API using **JSONP (JSON with Padding)** to bypass CORS restrictions. The code will be managed in a `google-sheets/` directory for version control, organized into logical files (e.g., `Code.gs` for the main entrypoint, `Finances.gs` for transaction logic, `Config.gs` for settings, and `Utils.gs` for helpers).

### Phase 2: Frontend User Interface
With the backend in place, we will build the user-facing web application.
- **Technology:** The frontend will be built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing a **JSONP client** to communicate with the Google Apps Script backend, and hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.
- **Core Features:**
    - Secure, key-based authentication.
    - A user-friendly form for adding new expense/income entries.
    - A clean, searchable table to view all financial records.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Analysis
Once the core application is functional, we will enhance it with more powerful features.
- **Data Visualization:** Integrate charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js) to create visual reports, such as breakdowns of expenses by category or event.
- **PDF Import Utility:** Develop a feature to help parse PDF bank statements and pre-fill the entry form, speeding up data entry.
- **Administrative Functions:** Build tools for administrative tasks, suchs as managing access keys.
