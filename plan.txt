# Project Plan: UMHC Finance Hub

## Phase 1: Foundation & Login

The project has been restarted with a focus on building a simple and secure foundation first.

### Completed:
- **Project Reset:** Removed initial complex structure for a more iterative approach.
- **Backend API:** A Google Apps Script (`Code.gs`) was created to act as a secure JSONP API.
- **Authentication:**
    - A basic login system has been implemented.
    - The web app authenticates against a key stored in cell A1 of the 'Config' Google Sheet.
    - A successful login displays a placeholder "Main Menu" screen.
- **Frontend:**
    - A simple login interface (`index.html`) was created.
    - Client-side logic (`js/app.js`) handles user input and communication with the backend API.

## Next Steps
- Develop the main menu functionality.
- Implement features for adding and viewing financial data.
